Project: Pest Surveillance System (PSS)

Description:

The Pest Surveillance System (PSS) is a comprehensive, role-based web application developed to modernize and streamline the process of agricultural pest surveillance. Built with Laravel, this data-driven platform digitalizes the entire data collection, management, and reporting workflow, replacing a manual, paper-based system. The PSS is designed to serve various stakeholders in the agricultural sector, including data collectors, administrators, and directors, by providing them with the tools and insights needed for effective pest management.

Key Features:

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The application implements a robust RBAC system, providing distinct interfaces and functionalities for different user roles:
    * Administrators: Have full control over the system, including user management, settings configuration, and access to all data and reports. They can manage user accounts, define roles and permissions, and oversee the entire data collection process.
    * Data Collectors: Are responsible for submitting pest-related data from the field. They have a dedicated interface for creating, editing, and managing their data entries, ensuring accurate and timely data collection.
    * Directors: Have access to high-level dashboards and reports, providing them with a comprehensive overview of the pest situation. This enables them to make informed decisions and strategic plans for pest control.

* Data Management: The PSS provides a centralized platform for managing all pest-related data. This includes:
    * Data Collection: A user-friendly interface for submitting data on various pests, including their location, severity, and other relevant details.
    * Data Validation: The system includes validation rules to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the collected data.
    * Data Reporting: The application generates a variety of reports, including PDF and Excel exports, to provide insights into the pest situation. These reports can be customized to meet the specific needs of different users.

* Data Visualization: The PSS uses Larapex Charts to provide interactive and insightful data visualizations. This includes:
    * Dashboards: Each user role has a dedicated dashboard that provides a quick overview of the most important data and metrics.
    * Charts and Graphs: The application generates a variety of charts and graphs to visualize pest trends, distribution, and other key indicators.

* System Administration: The PSS includes a comprehensive set of tools for system administration, including:
    * Audit Trails: The application keeps a detailed log of all user activities, ensuring accountability and transparency.
    * Email Notifications: The system sends out email notifications for important events, such as new user registrations and data submissions.
    * Settings Management: Administrators can configure various system settings, such as email templates and user roles.

Technologies Used:

* Backend: Laravel 9, PHP 8
